xsrfkr0k3 is an advanced Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF) Audit and Exploitation Toolkit. Equipped with a Powerful Crawling Engine and Numerous Systematic Checks, it is now able to detect most cases of CSRF vulnerabilities,their related bypasses and futher generate (maliciously) exploitable proof of concepts with each found vulnerability.

Do not use this tool on a live site!

It is because this tool is designed to perform all kinds of form submissions automatically which can sabotage the site. Sometimes you may screw up the database and most probably perform a DoS on the site as well.

Test on a disposable/dummy setup/site!
